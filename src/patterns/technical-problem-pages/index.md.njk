This pattern is currently experimental because [more research](#research-on-this-pattern) is needed to validate it.

This is a page that tells someone there is something wrong with the service. They are also known as 500 pages.

{{ example({group: 'patterns', item: 'technical-problem-pages', example: 'default', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

## When to use this pattern

Use a technical problem page when there is an unexpected problem with the service. Use the same page for all technical problems.

Log all errors and fix them as quickly as possibly.

Only display the page for a short time. If a problem cannot be fixed quickly, close the service and use a [service unavailable page](/patterns/service-unavailable-pages).

## How it works

Technical problem pages should have:

- "There is a problem with the service – [service name] – GOV.UK" as the page title
- “There is a problem with the service” as the H1
- “Try again later.” as a lead paragraph
- contact information, if it exists and helps meet a user need

Contact information should be either:

- a link to a specific GOV.UK contact page not a general contact page
- formatted like a GOV.UK contact page when there is no GOV.UK page

Have clear and concise content and do not use:

- breadcrumbs
- technical jargon like 500 or bad request 
- vague, unhelpful explanations like "We are experiencing technical difficulties"
- red text to warn people

### Service has a GOV.UK contact page

{{ example({group: 'patterns', item: 'technical-problem-pages', example: 'default', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

### Service has offline support but no GOV.UK contact page

{{ example({group: 'patterns', item: 'technical-problem-pages', example: 'service-replace', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

## Research on this pattern

More research is needed to find out:

- what people need to know
- what their expectations are after reading the page
- if people understand what is going on when they see the page
- if people expect to see please and sorry
