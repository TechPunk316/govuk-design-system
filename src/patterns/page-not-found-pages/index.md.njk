{% from "_example.njk" import example %}

A page not found tells someone we cannot find the page they were trying to view. They are also known as 404 pages.

{{ example({group: 'patterns', item: 'page-not-found-pages', example: 'default', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

## When to use this pattern

Use a page not found if someone is trying to view a page that does not exist. This happens if someone:

- selects a link or button that takes them to a page that does not exist
- types or copies a web address for a page that does not exist
- types or copies a web address incorrectly

Test all links and buttons to make sure they work. Remember to [do the hard work to make it simple](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#do-the-hard-work-to-make-it-simple).

Make sure any web addresses in your service, letters, forms and on GOV.UK are for pages that exist or redirect to pages that exist.

For example, if someone has bookmarked a confirmation or a page in the middle of a journey:

- explain that the information or page is no longer available
- give them a link or button to get to a sensible place in the service

## How it works

The page should have:

- “Page not found – service name – GOV.UK” as the page title
- “Page not found” as the H1
- contact information, if it exists and helps meet a user need

Contact information should either:

- be a link to a specific page that includes numbers and opening times
- include all numbers and opening times

The content should be clear and concise, not blame the user.

Do not use:

- breadcrumbs
- technical jargon like 404 or bad request
- informal or humourous words like oops
- red text to warn people

### Service mistake

{{ example({group: 'patterns', item: 'page-not-found-pages', example: 'default', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

### User mistake

{{ example({group: 'patterns', item: 'page-not-found-pages', example: 'user-mistake', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

### If you do not know why the page is not found

{{ example({group: 'patterns', item: 'page-not-found-pages', example: 'reason-not-known', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

When a user submits the form, take them to a confirmation page which has:

- "We have your details and what you were trying to do" as the H1
- "We will email you when we have fixed the service" as the body content

## Research on this pattern

More research is needed to find out if people:

- can fix the problem on their own
- understand what has happened
- understand the content and if there is anything missing
- would use a form to tell us about the problem and if that helps them
